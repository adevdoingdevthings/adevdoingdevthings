<h1 align="center">Hey!!</h1>
<p align="center">I'm adevdoingdevthings, better known as "Emberlyn" (or LandenHM)</p>

<h3 align="center">Tell me about yourself.</h3>
<p align="center">I am a 15 year old Canadian, I barely know anything about hardware, and a lot about software.</p>

<h3 align="center">What do you do?</h3>
<p align="center">I do not really develop under this name, don't expect much other than unprofessional and unorganized commits into my own unnamed repos.</p>

<h3 align="center">What languages do you know?</h3>
<p align="center">I am a Rust stan, but also like C++, C, HolyC, some very outdated Lua that I know, Python, and GDScript (most important language fr)</p>

<h3 align="center">What projects do you star?</h3>
<p align="center">Projects that I have used and can verify they function near perfectly to what I want or have potential for the future. You don't need to spend 100 hours on a project for me to star it, it just needs to be good.</p>

<h3 align="center">Do you have a website I may view?</h3>
<p align="center">Yep! Just go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 /j</p>
