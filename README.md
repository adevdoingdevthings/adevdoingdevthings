<h1 align="center">Hey!!</h1>
<p align="center">I'm adevdoingdevthings, better known as "Emberlyn" (or LandenHM)</p>
<h3 align="center">Tell me about yourself.</h3>
<p align="center">I am a 15 year old Canadian, I barely know anything about hardware, and a lot about software.</p>
<h3 align="center">What do you do?</h3>
<p align="center">I do not really develop under this name, don't expect much other than unprofessional and unorganized commits into my own unnamed repos.</p>
<h3 align="center">What languages do you know?</h3>
<p align="center">I am a Rust stan, but also like C++, C, HolyC, some very outdated Lua that I know, Python, and GDScript (most important language fr)</p>
