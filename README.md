# Hey!!
I'm adevdoingdevthings, better known as "Emberlyn" (or LandenHM)
### Tell me about yourself.
I am a 15 year old Canadian, I barely know anything about hardware, and a lot about software.
### What do you do?
I do not really develop under this name, don't expect much other than unprofessional and unorganized commits into my own unnamed repos.
### What languages do you know?
I am a Rust stan, but also like C++, C, HolyC, some very outdated Lua that I know, Python, and GDScript (most important language fr)
