<h1 align="center">Hey!!</h1>
<p align="center">I'm adevdoingdevthings, better known as "Emberlyn" (or LandenHM)</p>

<h3 align="center">🫵 Tell me about yourself.</h3>
<p align="center">I am a 16 year old Canadian, I barely know anything about hardware, and a lot about software.</p>

<h3 align="center">❔ What do you do?</h3>
<p align="center">I do not really develop under this name, don't expect much other than unprofessional and unorganized commits into my own unnamed repos.</p>

<h3 align="center">🗺️ What languages do you know?</h3>
<p align="center">I am a Rust stan, but also like C++, C, HolyC, some very outdated Lua that I know, Python, and GDScript (most important language fr)</p>

<h3 align="center">📜 What software licenses do you prefer?</h3>
<p align="center">While I do not have a license on most of my repos <i>yet</i>, I am most likely going to put aside my hatrid of GNU since the licenses are quite good and make my software either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#license-text">GNU GPLv3</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html#license-text">GNU AGPL</a> or <a href="https://opensource.org/license/0bsd">BSD 0-Clause</a></p>

<h3 align="center">⭐ What projects do you star?</h3>
<p align="center">Projects that I have used and can verify they function near perfectly to what I want or have potential for the future. You don't need to spend 100 hours on a project for me to star it, it just needs to be good.</p>

<h3 align="center">🌐 Do you have a website I may view?</h3>
<p align="center">Yep! Just go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 /j</p>
